/**
 * This class must be extended by the views to bind QModelIndex with a GUI element.
 *
 * This is the class implementation should use to navigate the model indices. It
 * provides a simple geometric linked list between indices and provide built-in
 * memory management, including recycling.
 *
 * This is optionally a template class to avoid having to perform static casts
 * when implementing.
 *
 * All moderately cartesian views such as list, table, trees and most charts
 * should use this class along with `ViewBase`. Graphs and advanced
 * visualizations should probably use a lower level API.
 *
 * These objects are created if and only if those 2 conditions are met:
 *
 *  * The QModelIndex is currently part of a tracked range (see VisibleRange).
 *  * It didn't fail to load.
 *
 * If the overloaded functions returns false, then the consumer of this
 * class should no longer use the object as it may have been deleted or
 * recycled.
 *
 * Note that this should **NEVER** be stored and an instance may be reused for
 * other indices or deleted without prior notice. The memory management of this
 * class is designed for high performance, not ease of use. If you are
 * implementing views in C++, then this is probably what you want, so think
 * twice before cursing at how low level this is.
 *
 * Note that this object usage should be strictly limited to its overloaded
 * functions and external usage (from the view class or elsewhere) is
 * strongly discouraged. If you think the provided interface isn't enough,
 * report a bug rather than work around it to avoid crashes.
